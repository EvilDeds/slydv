*Slides for Developers*

Slydv was developed with developers in mind.   This slick and simple application is constructed to be accessible, secure, and to take the headaches out of making presentation materials (and keep them in your coding, where they belong). 

Slydv allows you to make a slideshow without distracting yourself, providing easy to use, easy to edit markdown based templates, and, best of all, an in-slide repl that can be both pre-populated and live-edited to run your JavaScript code examples in front of your audience, without having to jump in and out of different applications. 

A separate presenter-view lets you keep track of where you are in your slide deck, while viewing any notes or scripts you've made for each slide. Presenter view can also email you a link to a responsive remote control page intended for use on a mobile phone or tablet.

Your audience can get engaged with your presentation via a chat feature, which you can see and and respond to as you're presenting.


Slydv is written using JavaScript, react-redux, Sequelize, Postgres, and socket.io, among others.
